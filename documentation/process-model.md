Spiral Model
After learning the requirements, we discussed using different languages, how to store the information, and how to interpret what is happening with the user, and any other options. There was a culmination of water-fall, code-and-fix, but overall the process model that represents our process is the spiral model(Spiral-Model-img)

The spiral model is implemented by spiraling from 1-4 in a circular motion with every pass building a new prototype.
1. Determine objectives(review) - ex. Requirements plan → 2. Identify and resolve risks(Progress) - Concept of requirements→ 3. Develop and test -> ex. Verification and Validation → 4. Plan the next iteration(release) 




Each iteration has a progressive or iterative approach. That spirals outward going from one phase to another. We haven’t used a lot of javascript or node.js so there was some exploration into what languages would beneficial to implement. A group member created a static implementation which we then implemented our idea's into. Part of this strategy is from the model code-and-fix. We met as a group but we still faced challenges communicating and being on the same page. The model code-and-fix was helpful but also difficult if each person develops their on code-and-fix on a different branch.
